## BbLearn, Collaborate Ultra & Recorded Lectures
We will use the learning management system, BbLearn, to conduct some course business, including assignment disbursement and submitting. We will use BbLearn’s Collaborate Ultra to record lectures for future viewing. 

## INF511 Book Website
We have compiled a [course website](https://joseph-mihaljevic.github.io/inf511-book/) and associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joseph-mihaljevic/inf511-book). This website will have coded examples that we will walk through in class, and which will be required reading. There will be other required reading materials (see @sec-readings).

## Course Purpose
INF 511 Modern Regression I is the first course in a two-semester sequence required for the MS and PhD in Informatics and Computing (INF). (See INF 512 Modern Regression II.) These courses are designed to serve the computationally oriented statistical analysis needs of the INF graduate program. Through a series of hands-on individual or team-based assignments, students will master statistical analyses, from preparing data, exploring data using numerical and/or graphical methods, modeling data, diagnosing model assumptions, remodeling and final inference. This course will provide INF graduate students with the necessary foundation for more specialized statistical methods and applications that students will encounter in subsequent INF courses, such as INF 626 Applied Bayesian Modeling and the more prediction-oriented INF 504 Data Mining and Machine Learning. More generally, INF 511 provides skills widely applicable to analysis of data across science and engineering.

INF 511 Modern Regression I covers fundamental probability models and their use in the analysis of independent data with linear models within both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. Random variables, expectation, variance, covariance, correlation. Joint, conditional and marginal distributions. Linear combinations of random variables; central limit theorem; matrices, vectors, basic matrix arithmetic, matrix formulation of linear statistical models (regression and ANOVA) for independent data, normal likelihood, least squares, Gauss-Markov theorem, $t$ and $F$ sampling distribution-based inference for linear combinations of parameters. Corresponding Bayesian analysis including prior and posterior distributions, introductory Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Diagnostics, including graphical residual analysis. Scope of inference (randomization and causality, random sampling and population).

## Course Student Learning Outcomes
The overall learning outcome for this course is a demonstrated acquisition of skills and conceptual understanding of statistical methods to enable complete and valid statistical analyses of primarily independent data modeled with relatively traditional linear statistical models from both a frequentist and Bayesian perspective at a level commensurate with high expectations of a well-trained graduate student in the quantitatively and computationally intensive field of informatics. For these data, and using the methods and concepts detailed in the Course Purpose, students should be able to:

- Use numerical and graphical exploratory data analysis tools to prepare data and to develop conceptual mod- els of data
- Transform conceptual models of data into formal linear statistical models of data
- Implement linear model methods in modern software, such as R or Stan, to analyze data
- Demonstrate an understanding that models are an abstracted simplification of real processes by effectively
using linear model diagnostics, remedial measures, remodeling and final model validation/confirmation
methods.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of data and methods by communicating how the data and
methods relate to randomization and causality, random selection and population, over-fitting and exploratory/confirmatory analyses, and the trade-off between efficiency of inference and robustness to departures from method assumptions
- Demonstrate an ability to work effectively in a team environment to solve realistic problems, which may be beyond any one individual!s ability to address, as indicated by peer review or other assessments of team- work.

## Assessments of Course Student Learning Outcomes {#sec-assess}
There will be three assessment strategies: problem sets, homework, and quizzes. Problem sets will have dedicated in-class time to complete, whereas homework assignments will be done entirely outside of class. **Problem sets** will be completed **individually**, and will be primarily assessed as complete/incomplete, whereas **Homework** assignments can be completed in **teams of one to three students** and will be graded in full. Assignment format is designed in part to mimic and reinforce the similar presentation of analyses in class/notes and to encourage discussion among students. There will be five **in-class Quizzes**, one every $\sim$3 weeks, in lieu of exams. Attendance & Participaiton will also be used to assess your course performance.

## Grading System

| Problem Sets | Homework | Quizzes | Attendance |
|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| 20%          | 35%      | 40%     | 5%         |

- **Attendance & Participation**. In-person attendance is required. See [University Policy](https://nau.edu/university-policy-library/student-institutional-excuses/) on excused absences. You are responsible to plan with your fellow classmates to obtain in-class material not received due to your absence. (Recall that lectures will be recorded and will be available in BbLearn.) Participation in the form of responding to questions in class, asking questions, and attending office hours may be used to determine "borderline" grade cases.

::: {.callout-important}
## Prior notification of absence

**A student must notify a TA prior to absence**. Students should notify a TA of an upcoming absence via email, and the TA will evaluate whether the absence will be counted as excused or unexcused. Only students with excused absences will be allowed to attend lecture virtually, via Bblearn Collaborate Ultra. 
:::

- **Assignments**. There are two categories of assignments, Problem Sets and Homework. See @sec-assess for the distinctions. See @sec-schedule for due-dates. Assignments will be posted periodically via BbLearn. Assignments are to be submitted electronically, via BbLearn, on the due date/time indicated in BbLearn. For Homework, students are free to arrange different teams for different homeworks; this will not be monitored. For Homework, please ensure that *all team member names are on a submitted assignment*. Everyone on a team will submit exactly same homework; only one team member’s submission will be selected and graded with all members receiving the same score. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Late assignments

**Late assignments will not be accepted**. Late assignments will receive zero points. 
:::


- **Quizzes**. There will be five in-class quizzes that are all cumulative. Each quiz will be designed to take approximately 15-20 minutes, and each will be scaled to 100 points so that they are equally weighted. 

::: {.callout-important}
## In-class quizzes

**If a student does not attend a class when a quiz is given, that quiz will receive zero points**. The only exception is if a student notifies the TA, *before class*, of an impending absence. The absence must be formally excused in writing by the TA *before class* for a make-up quiz to be considered. Therefore, the notification of absence must be received *at least several hours prior* to class time. 
:::


## Course Grades
Overall course grades will follow a typical scale:

| To earn the letter grade ->    | A | B | C | D | F |
|:-------------------------------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| You need *at least* this score | 90| 80| 70| 60| 0 |

While you should be able to compute an estimate of your current grade using the information above, I (or your TA) will attempt to use the Grade feature in BbLearn so that you are able to check your grades. Grading mistakes may occur, and students are encouraged to discuss such concerns with the instructor or TA during office hours or by appointment.

## Readings and Materials {#sec-readings}

- **Lecture Materials**: Lecture topics, course notes, readings, and assignments will be made available as the semester progresses. For each lecture, a document will be linked on the [course website](https://joseph-mihaljevic.github.io/inf511-book/). During lecture, we will work together to fill out this document with written notes presented on the (virtual) whiteboard. **Therefore, it is essential to downlaod and print these materials prior to attending class.**

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
NAU expects every student to firmly adhere to a strong ethical code of academic integrity in all their scholarly pursuits. The primary attributes of academic integrity are honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, and responsibility. As a student, you are expected to submit original work while giving proper credit to other people’s ideas or contributions. Acting with academic integrity means completing your assignments independently while truthfully acknowledging all sources of information, or collaboration with others when appropriate. When you submit your work, you are implicitly declaring that the work is your own. Academic integrity is expected not only during formal coursework, but in all your relationships or interactions that are connected to the educational enterprise. All forms of academic deceit such as plagiarism, cheating, collusion, falsification or fabrication of results or records, permitting your work to be submitted by another, or inappropriately recycling your own work from one class to another, constitute academic misconduct that may result in serious disciplinary consequences. All students and faculty members are responsible for reporting suspected instances of academic misconduct. All students are encouraged to complete NAU’s online academic integrity workshop available in the E-Learning Center and should review the full Academic Integrity policy available at <https://policy.nau.edu/policy/policy.aspx?num=100601>.

If you have a documented disability, you can request assistance by contacting Disability Resources at 928-523-8773 (voice), ,928-523-8747 (fax), or dr@nau.edu (e-mail). Once eligibility has been determined, students register with Disability Resources every semester to activate their approved accommodations. Although a student may request an accommodation at any time, it is best to initiate the application process at least four weeks before a student wishes to receive an accommodation. Students may begin the accommodation process by submitting a self-identification form online at <https://nau.edu/disability-resources/student-eligibility-process> or by contacting Disability Resources. The Director of Disability Resources, Jamie Axelrod, serves as NAU’s Americans with Disabilities Act Coordinator and Section 504 Compliance Officer. He can be reached at jamie.axelrod@nau.edu.

### RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH
Students who engage in research at NAU must receive appropriate Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training. This instruction is designed to help ensure proper awareness and application of well-established professional norms and ethical principles related to the performance of all scientific research activities. More information regarding RCR training is available at <https://nau.edu/research/compliance/research-integrity>.

### MISCONDUCT IN RESEARCH
As noted, NAU expects every student to firmly adhere to a strong code of academic integrity in all their scholarly pursuits. This includes avoiding fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism when conducting research or reporting research results. Engaging in research misconduct may result in serious disciplinary consequences. Students must also report any suspected or actual instances of research misconduct of which they become aware. Allegations of research misconduct should be reported to your instructor or the University’s Research Integrity Officer, Dr. David Faguy, who can be reached at david.faguy@nau.edu or 928-523-6117. More information about misconduct in research is available at <https://nau.edu/university-policy-library/misconduct-in-research>.

### SENSITIVE COURSE MATERIALS
University education aims to expand student understanding and awareness. Thus, it necessarily involves engagement with a wide range of information, ideas, and creative representations. In their college studies, students can expect to encounter and to critically appraise materials that may differ from and perhaps challenge familiar understandings, ideas, and beliefs. Students are encouraged to discuss these matters with faculty.
